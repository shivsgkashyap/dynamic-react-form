# Dynamic react form

This app takes the sign up/registration form to the next level. This is a dynamic form project created using react. This allows programmers to pass the type of input they desire eg. input box, text area, checkbox etc as a prop and it will automatically render to the screen with styling applied. The component rendering the input accepts several parameters as props eg. label, placeHolder, an error message function to handle required fields and many more to allow customisation to the input with simple lines of code. This is incredibly useful in sign up/registration forms where all the inputs look similar but differ slightly in values e.g text.
